"[[""What is binarization ?"", ""Binarization is the process of transforming a continuous data feature into a binary (binary-digit) variable. In other words, it involves assigning a value of 0 or 1 to each data point based on some threshold value. This technique is often used in machine learning and recommender systems to convert features with large ranges into features that have equal or close values.""]]",,,2024-09-26 13:02:04.704016
"[[""How to engineer a categorical feature ?"", ""To engineer a categorical feature, one-hot encoding is a common method used. This involves creating a binary vector where each category is represented by a separate bit, and only one bit can be \""on\"" at a time. For example, if you have a categorical variable with 3 categories (e.g., eye color), the resulting encoded feature would be a 3-dimensional vector with all zeros except for one position that corresponds to each category. This method is implemented in scikit-learn as sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.""]]",,,2024-09-26 13:05:22.319930
