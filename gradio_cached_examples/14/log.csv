"[[""What is binarization ?"", ""Binarization is a process in data preprocessing where categorical variables are converted into numerical values using binary encoding or digitization. This technique involves assigning two distinct categories to each observation, typically 0 and 1, with 1 representing the \""on\"" or dominant category. Binarization can be used for features such as class labels, response variables, or any other type of categorical data that cannot be represented by a single numerical value.""]]",,,2024-09-28 03:29:12.675491
"[[""How to engineer a categorical feature ?"", ""To engineer a categorical feature in numeric data, you can use techniques such as encoding, one-hot encoding, or label encoding. Encoding involves mapping each category in the categorical variable into a numerical value, while one-hot encoding represents each category as a separate binary vector and then reduces the dimensionality of the dataset. Label encoding converts all categories to one-hot vectors without losing any information, but it requires careful consideration to avoid overfitting.""]]",,,2024-09-28 03:30:24.509837
