"[[""What is binarization ?"", ""Binarization involves converting numerical features into binary values. Typically, this conversion uses a threshold to decide whether the feature should be 0 or 1. This technique simplifies the data and reduces dimensionality for models that perform better with categorical representations.""]]",,,2024-10-11 00:30:59.629406
"[[""How to engineer a categorical feature ?"", ""To engineer a categorical feature, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean value of each category across all available data.\n2. Fill in the unknown with a special value like -1 or ignore instances that are not important for your task.\n3. Use a mean value from similar items to create a new feature based on how they relate.\n\nRemember, this approach can help improve model performance by providing more meaningful input features.""]]",,,2024-10-11 00:32:14.256653
